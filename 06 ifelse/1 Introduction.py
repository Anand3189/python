#Flow-control stmts:

Every python stmt executes only once from top to bottom

-In-order to execute or not to execute set of stmts,we go for flow-control stmts
#or
-To execute set of stmts for repeated no of times or for multiple times,
 we go for loops/control structures

#Flow-control stmts are divided into 2 parts
1.Condition: An expression which returns a boolean value
             
2.Block/Clause:set of stmts following the same space indentation

#Various flow-control stmts/loops are:
1.if
2.if-else
3.elif
4.for
5.while
6.while-else
7.break
8.continue
9.pass

#Syntax for defining if-else
if(condition):
    stmt1
    stmt2------->block1
    stmt3
    stmt4
else:
    stmt5
    stmt6------>Block2
    stmt7
    stmt8
If the condition is True, then the stmts within the if-block(block1) executes
If the condition is False then the stmts within the else-block(block2) executes
